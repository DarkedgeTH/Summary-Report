# Summary-Report
I built this project for a college web design course during the Spring 2019 semester.

This project features:
- Validating the data entry in the summary field
- Summing up all the data values for elements of the sumClass class
- Calculating the travel expenses from all categories and dates
- Formatting the value, "val" to U.S. currency and the number of decimals

To run the project: 
- Open the dl_expense.html file
- Fill out the information as instructed
- Fill the chart with different amounts
- Click "Submit Report."

The program will validate that you entered all the correct information and calculate your amounts.
